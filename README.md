# RunningToast_Pygame
A simple running game developed on Pygame. (Source code on 'master' branch)

This application is purely a passion project aimed to help me familiarize with the Pygame library along with developing better Python coding practices through implementations of various of features.

In order to play the game:
1. Download all files in the master branch. Ensure all files can be found in one encompassing folder.
2. Go onto a terminal, and navigate to the folder.
3. Run the 'runningGame.py' file. A window featuring the game should pop up.
4. Avoid oncoming obstacles. Press the space bar to jump.
5. Once you are struck by an obstacle, it's game over. Press space bar to play again.
6. Exit the game by closing the window.

Score is based on how many obstacles have been avoided.
